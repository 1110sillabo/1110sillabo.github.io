Sometimes you need a common roof for all your stuff.

I have some fancy titles (Ph.D., Post-doc) earned under different acronyms (and not). Self-tracker and music-obsessed, I need to have everything under one roof and here we go. Basically I need to add some (alphabetical) order to present the different stuff I do/did. Plus, building a house is a learning opportunity.

Posts and cats are below, more infos in [about](/about).
